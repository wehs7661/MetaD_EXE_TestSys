Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 0.11102 0.02917 -0.71918 -2.35706 -2.91998
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 0.11 0.03 -0.72 -2.36 -2.92
