Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 0.17859 0.06732 -0.74963 -3.03979 -3.70856
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 0.18 0.07 -0.75 -3.04 -3.71
