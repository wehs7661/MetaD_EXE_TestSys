Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 0.12531 0.16907 -0.15424 -1.74945 -2.35089
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 0.13 0.17 -0.15 -1.75 -2.35
