Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 0.10349 -0.05134 -0.65958 -2.2981 -2.844
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 0.1 -0.05 -0.66 -2.3 -2.84
Check the log file for more information.
The maximum and minimum of the free energy difference estimate are: -2.82694 and -2.844, respectively. (Range: 0.017059999999999853)
The standard deviation of the free energy difference:  0.09969.
The average weights over the last 1.0 ns of the simulation before the weights are equilibrated (from 4.0 to 5.0 ns) are:
