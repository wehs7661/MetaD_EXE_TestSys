Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 0.11799 0.00449 -0.69957 -2.33637 -2.90392
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 0.12 0.0 -0.7 -2.34 -2.9
Check the log file for more information.
The maximum and minimum of the free energy difference estimate are: -2.90392 and -3.42638, respectively. (Range: 0.5224600000000001)
The standard deviation of the free energy difference:  0.12191.
The average weights over the last 1.0 ns of the simulation before the weights are equilibrated (from 4.0 to 5.0 ns) are:
