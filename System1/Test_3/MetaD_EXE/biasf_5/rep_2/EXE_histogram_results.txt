Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 0.16034 0.13849 -0.56643 -2.2847 -2.87161
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 0.16 0.14 -0.57 -2.28 -2.87
