Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 0.11478 0.00694 -0.72845 -2.53887 -3.14427
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 0.11 0.01 -0.73 -2.54 -3.14
Check the log file for more information.
The maximum and minimum of the free energy difference estimate are: -3.0582 and -3.50212, respectively. (Range: 0.4439200000000003)
The standard deviation of the free energy difference:  0.09040.
The average weights over the last 1.0 ns of the simulation before the weights are equilibrated (from 4.0 to 5.0 ns) are:
