Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 0.11246 -0.0509 -0.95575 -2.94055 -3.5618
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 0.11 -0.05 -0.96 -2.94 -3.56
Check the log file for more information.
The maximum and minimum of the free energy difference estimate are: -3.83014 and -3.5618, respectively. (Range: -0.26834000000000024)
The standard deviation of the free energy difference:  0.27845.
The average weights over the last 1.0 ns of the simulation before the weights are equilibrated (from 4.0 to 5.0 ns) are:
