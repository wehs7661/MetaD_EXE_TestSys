Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 0.14908 0.082 -0.73157 -2.66235 -3.29379
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 0.15 0.08 -0.73 -2.66 -3.29
Check the log file for more information.
The maximum and minimum of the free energy difference estimate are: -3.2854 and -3.29379, respectively. (Range: 0.008389999999999898)
The standard deviation of the free energy difference:  0.33792.
The average weights over the last 1.0 ns of the simulation before the weights are equilibrated (from 4.0 to 5.0 ns) are:
