The log file(s) to be analyzed: sys1.log.
Length of the simulation for the weights average calculation: 20 ns.

Data analysis of the file sys1.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 -0.5 -1.49999 -2.49998 -3.99997 -5.49996
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 -0.5 -1.5 -2.5 -4.0 -5.5
Check the log file for more information.
The starting point of the weights average calculation is less than 0!
Please specified a shorter length of simulation for the weights average calculation.
