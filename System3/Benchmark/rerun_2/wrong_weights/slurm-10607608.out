Reading file sys3.tpr, VERSION 2020.2-MODIFIED (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 0.9 to 1.004

Using 28 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 4 OpenMP threads per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Untitled'
10000000 steps,  20000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 0.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 74%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.3%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.180
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 32.0 %

NOTE: 32.0 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
