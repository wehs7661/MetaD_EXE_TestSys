GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2020.2-MODIFIED
Executable:   /home/wehs7661/pkgs/gromacs/2020.2/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /home/wehs7661/pkgs/gromacs/2020.2
Working dir:  /pylon5/ct4s8bp/wehs7661/MetaD_EXE_TestSys/System3/Benchmark/rerun_2
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s sys3.tpr -x sys3.xtc -c sys3_output.gro -e sys3.edr -dhdl sys3_dhdl.xvg -g sys3.log -cpi state.cpt

Reading file sys3.tpr, VERSION 2020.2-MODIFIED (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 0.9 to 1.004

Using 28 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 4 OpenMP threads per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Untitled'
50000000 steps, 100000.0 ps (continuing from step 29883120,  59766.2 ps).

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 0.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 69%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.3%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.209
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 28.6 %

NOTE: 28.6 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
