Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 734.1%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 9%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 66.3%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.116
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 35.3 %

NOTE: 66.3 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 35.3 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
