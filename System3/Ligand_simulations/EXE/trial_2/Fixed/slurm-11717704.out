GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2020.2-MODIFIED
Executable:   /home/wehs7661/pkgs/gromacs/2020.2/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /home/wehs7661/pkgs/gromacs/2020.2

Reading file sys3_gst.tpr, VERSION 2020.2-MODIFIED (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 0.9 to 1.002

Using 168 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Untitled'
50000000 steps, 100000.0 ps (continuing from step 10000000,  20000.0 ps).

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up sys3_gst_output.gro to ./#sys3_gst_output.gro.1#


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 1001.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 7%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 66.0%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.163
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 30.6 %

NOTE: 66.0 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 30.6 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
