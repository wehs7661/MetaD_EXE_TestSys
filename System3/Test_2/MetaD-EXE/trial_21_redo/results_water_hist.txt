- Command line: /home/wei-tse/.local/bin/plot_hist -i COLVARa -x Number of water molecules -n water_hist
Assessment of the hsitogram flatness: N_ratio = 43316.000
The maximum of number of water molecules is 17.837342.
The minimum of number of water molecules is 0.088240.
The total number of counts is 4588456.
Number of water molecules between 0.443222 and 0.531968 has the highest probability density.
