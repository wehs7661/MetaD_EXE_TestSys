Reading file sys3.tpr, VERSION 2021.4-plumed-2.8.0 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 0.9 to 1.004

Using 128 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Untitled'
100000000 steps, 200000.0 ps (continuing from step 75000000, 150000.0 ps).

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up sys3_output.gro to ./#sys3_output.gro.3#


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 0.6%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 50%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.3%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.137
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 21.4 %

NOTE: 21.4 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
