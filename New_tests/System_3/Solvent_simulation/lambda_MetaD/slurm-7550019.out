Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 25.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 58%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 14.7%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.176
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 31.9 %

NOTE: 14.7 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 31.9 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
