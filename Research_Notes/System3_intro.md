# Test system 3: CB8-G3: a host guest binding complex
###### tags: `MetaD-EXE-TestSys`
CB8-G3 binding complex is composed of cucurbit[8]uril (CB8, host) and quinine (G3, guest) and is one of the host-guest binding complexes in SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge. Unlike other two host-guest binding complexes (OA-G3 and OA-G6) in the same challenge, CB8-G3 is a more challenging case due to the water exclusion problem. In the [SAMPL6 paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10822-020-00290-5.pdf), it was shown that with expanded ensemble, it was not possible to equilibrate the Wang-Landau weights within the same time as OA-G3/G6. Moreover, OpenMM/SOMD and NAMD/BAR replicate calculations could not converge the average free energy to uncertainties below 1 kcal/mol, and OpenMM/HREX and AMBER/APR displayed a significant and slowly decaying bias. Therefore, here we want to see if alchemical metadynamics is able to outperform the existing methods. To this end, in the first test, we perform a 1-dimensional metadynamics biasing the number of water molecules in the binding cavity. Basically, the file preparation and the metadynamics folloaw the same protocol as done in the note [Water Exclusion Problem of OA-G3 Host-guest Binding Complex](https://hackmd.io/@WeiTseHsu/water-exclusion).
