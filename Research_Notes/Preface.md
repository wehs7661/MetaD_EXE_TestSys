# Test systems for the development of MetaD-EXE sampling method
This is a documentation of the simulation details of the test systems for the development of alchemical metadynamics (MetaD-EXE). Some details of implementation, preparation of the test systems, or the data analysis are also included. Here, except that the Test system 1 was prepared using GROMACS 2018.1 (which should have no influences on the results), all other preparations and the simulations were performed using GROMACS 2020.1 or 2020.2. All the files relevant to this document are hosted in [MetaD_EXE_TestSys](https://github.com/wehs7661/MetaD_EXE_TestSys.git) on GitHub. In addition, all the notes are in the folder [Research_Notes](https://github.com/wehs7661/MetaD_EXE_TestSys/tree/master/Research_Notes) in the repository. Every note has its own corresponding version x.y.z, where x starts from 0 and y, z starts from 1. Whenever we run tests on a newly developed implementation, run new tests using the same implementation for fixed minor things in the same notes (typos or additional information), we add x, y, and z by 1, respectively.
