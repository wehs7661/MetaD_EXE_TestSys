Here we compare the performance between 2D alchemical metadynamics simjulations with the benchmark expanded ensemble simulation. The plan is to run 3-5 reps of 2D alchemical metadynamics for 100 ns, which has the same length as the benchmark EXE simulation and compare the uncertainty to see which ones converged faster. (System of interest: System 2)
