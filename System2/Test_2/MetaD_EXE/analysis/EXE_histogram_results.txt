Data analysis of the file sys2.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 5.0 9.5 14.0 14.5 14.5 13.0 -1.5 -5.0
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 5.0 9.5 14.0 14.5 14.5 13.0 -1.5 -5.0
