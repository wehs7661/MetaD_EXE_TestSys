This folder contains additional tests of System 2, in which we increased the magnitude of the force constant of the dihedral potential relevant to the intramolecular hydrogen bond. Since the energy barrier between the metastable states had been made larger, we expected expanded ensemble and 1D lambda MetaD would not be able to sample all the intermediate states. In this case, our goal is to show that 2D lambda MetaD is able to sample both metastable states. The point here is not compare the energy difference with the benchmark (and we don't have a benchmark for this case), but to show that 2D lamba MetaD is superior than 1D in a more complicated case. (In the original setup, 2D is not obvsiously better than 1D since the problem was too simple.) Specifically, the following summarized what had been done:
- We first copied Prep folder and deleted the output files and irrelevant files
- We changed the force constant of the dihedral potential relavant to atoms 4 (O), 2 (C), 1 (C), and 5 (C) from -2.4996348 to -20 (Line 124 in system.top).
- We re-performed energy minimization, equilibration and the short MD simulation with the modified topology file (system.top). In Final_inputs folder, the .gro file is the output .gro file of the short MD, while the .top file is the modified .top file.
