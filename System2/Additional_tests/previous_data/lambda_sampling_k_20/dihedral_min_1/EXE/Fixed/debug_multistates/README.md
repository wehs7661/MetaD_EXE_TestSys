As a result of running extract_config.py, we got "At lambda=0, the largest and smallest dihedral angles are -51.700 (t = 184.9 ns) and -129.668 (t = 77.8 ns), respectively.". Therefore, we extracted these to configurations and use them as the initial strucutre for metadynamics only biasing the dihedral angle.
