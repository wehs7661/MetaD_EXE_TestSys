The log file(s) to be analyzed: sys2.log.
Length of the simulation for the weights average calculation: 1.0 ns.

Data analysis of the file sys2.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 8.492 14.09921 17.468 19.34573 20.45465 20.93301 18.71658 16.38594
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 8.49 14.1 17.47 19.35 20.45 20.93 18.72 16.39
Check the log file for more information.
The maximum and minimum of the free energy difference estimate are: 18.78603 and 14.3803, respectively. (Range: 4.40573)
The standard deviation of the free energy difference:  1.13397.
The average weights over the last 1.0 ns of the simulation before the weights are equilibrated (from 4.0 to 5.0 ns) are:
