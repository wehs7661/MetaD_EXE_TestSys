Data analysis of the file sys2.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 7.66493 14.31766 16.61884 19.12251 20.71396 20.55388 17.39571 14.62198
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 7.66 14.32 16.62 19.12 20.71 20.55 17.4 14.62
Check the log file for more information.
The maximum and minimum of the free energy difference estimate are: 18.76926 and 11.74265, respectively. (Range: 7.02661)
The standard deviation of the free energy difference:  1.62742.
The average weights over the last 1.0 ns of the simulation before the weights are equilibrated (from 4.0 to 5.0 ns) are:
