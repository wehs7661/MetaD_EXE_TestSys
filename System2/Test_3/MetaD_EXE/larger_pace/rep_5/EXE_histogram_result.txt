Data analysis of the file sys2.log:
===================================
The weights have not equilibrated.
Initial weights: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Final weights:   0.0 6.72363 12.62607 15.37881 17.40649 19.14908 19.94952 16.15468 13.68916
The difference between the initial weights and final weights are:
0.0 6.72 12.63 15.38 17.41 19.15 19.95 16.15 13.69
Check the log file for more information.
The maximum and minimum of the free energy difference estimate are: 17.93227 and 12.29254, respectively. (Range: 5.639729999999998)
The standard deviation of the free energy difference:  1.21695.
The average weights over the last 1.0 ns of the simulation before the weights are equilibrated (from 4.0 to 5.0 ns) are:
